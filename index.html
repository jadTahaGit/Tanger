          Our Research was based on using the extract of the orchid flower, this
          Amazonian flower, known for its tolerance to harsh weather conditions
          and high temperatures, and that its extract is an alternative to
          refreshing and maintaining hair, so it is used in preparations that
          are used to care for hair, as it removes hair from the accumulated
          chemical substances that prevent it from growing and revitalising the
          hair’s natural components Alpha keratin that builds upon the hair,
          causes it to become inactive and prevents it from growing. And it
          eliminates the fungi that infect the hair follicle.

          The most important thing it helps to revive and revitalise the stem
          cells and regenerate them without using injection exactly as the
          plasma principle by absorbing it by the cells. Our AS invention worked
          well on Women’s hair, in European and Arab countries, especially the
          Gulf and Saudi Arabia in particular, it revolutionised hair treatments
          and dealt with the problems caused by heat, moisture, and salty water
          on the hair, especially in these regions. The results were very
          tangible and not just theoretical.

          not stop at providing the best solutions for treating hair problems
