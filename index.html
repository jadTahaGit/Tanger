          <p>
            Our Research was based on using the extract of the orchid flower,
            this Amazonian flower, known for its tolerance to harsh weather
            conditions and high temperatures, and that its extract is an
            alternative to refreshing and maintaining hair, so it is used in
            preparations that are used to care for hair, as it removes hair from
            the accumulated chemical substances that prevent it from growing and
            revitalising the hair’s natural components Alpha keratin that builds
            upon the hair, causes it to become inactive and prevents it from
            growing. And it eliminates the fungi that infect the hair follicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important thing it helps to revive and revitalise the stem
            cells and regenerate them without using injection exactly as the
            plasma principle by absorbing it by the cells. Our AS invention
            worked well on Women’s hair, in European and Arab countries,
            especially the Gulf and Saudi Arabia in particular, it
            revolutionised hair treatments and dealt with the problems caused by
            heat, moisture, and salty water on the hair, especially in these
            regions. The results were very tangible and not just theoretical.

            Lebanese international hair expert Ahmad Slieman, whose experience
            did not stop at providing the best solutions for treating hair
            problems through his therapeutic and hair care innovations, but
            rather changed the concepts of hair treatments for many women that
            may harm the hair and which some people mistakenly believe are
            beneficial. It did not stop at that, but AS HAIRCARE was considered
            a revolution in the world of hair care and treatment.
          </p>
          <p>

            invention are back to his father, after years of research, going
            back twenty years or more when the Brazilian Keratin Treatment was
            introduced to the market, it was discovered that it causes cancer
            after about six months because it contains formaldehydr.
